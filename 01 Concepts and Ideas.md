## Replication
* The	ultimate	standard	for	strengthening	scientific	evidence	is	replication	of	findings	and	conducting	studies	with independent	
 – Investigators
 – Data	
 – Analytical	methods	
 – Laboratories	
 – Instruments	
* Replication	is	particularly	important	in	studies	that	can	impact	broad	policy	or	regulatory	decisions	

## What's wrong with Replication?
* Some	studies	cannot	be	replicated	
 – No	5me,	opportunis5c	
 – No	money	
 – Unique	
* Reproducible	Research:	Make	analytic	data	and	code	available	so	that	others	may	reproduce	findings	

## How can we brige the gap?
Replication <---> Reproduciblity <---> NOthing

## Why do we need reproducible research?
* New	technologies	increasing	data	collection	throughput;	data	are	more	complex	and	extremely	high	dimensional	  
* Existing	databases	can	be	merged	into	new	“megadatabases”	  
* Computing	power	is	greatly	increased,	allowing	more	sophisticated	analyses	  
* For	every	field	“X”	there	is	a	field	“Computa5onal	X”
