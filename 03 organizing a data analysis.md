## Data analysis files
* Data
 + Raw data
    + Should be stored in your analysis folder
    + If accessed from the web, include url, description, and date accessed in README  
 + Processed data
    + Processed data should be named so it is easy to see which script generated the data.
    + The processing script - processed data mapping should occur in the README
    + Processed data should be tidy

* Figures
 + Exploratory figures
    + Figures made during the course of your analysis, not necessarily part of your final report.
    + They do not need to be "pretty"
 + Final figures
    + Usually a small subset of the original figures
    + Axes/colors set to make the figure clear
    + Possibly multiple panels
* R code
 + Raw / unused scripts
    + May be less commented (but comments help you!)
    + May be multiple versions
    + May include analyses that are later discarded
 + Final scripts
    + Clearly commented
      - Small comments liberally - what, when, why, how
      - Bigger commented blocks for whole sections
    + Include processing details
    + Only analyses that appear in the final write-up


 + R Markdown files
    + R markdown files can be used to generate reproducible reports
    + Text and R code are integrated
    + Very easy to create in Rstudio
· · ·

* Text
 + README files
    + Not necessary if you use R markdown
    + Should contain step-by-step instructions for analysis
    + Here is an example <https://github.com/jtleek/swfdr/blob/master/README>
· · ·
 + Text of analysis / report
    + It should include a title, introduction (motivation), methods (statistics you used), results (including
measures of uncertainty), and conclusions (including potential problems)
    + It should tell a story
    + It should not include every analysis you performed
    + References should be included for statistical methods
